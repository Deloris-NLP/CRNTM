percentage of diffusely reflect sun light in relation to various surface condition of the earth the albedo of an object be the extent to which it diffusely reflect light from light source such as the sun . it be therefore a more specific form of the term reflectivity . albedo be define as the ratio of diffusely reflect to incident electromagnetic radiation . it be a unitless measure indicative of a surface 's or body 's diffuse reflectivity . the word be derive from latin albedo "whiteness" , in turn from albus "white" , and be introduce into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work photometria . the range of possible value be from 0 ( dark ) to 1 ( bright ) . the albedo be an important concept in climatology and astronomy , as well as in computer graphic and computer vision . in climatology it be sometimes express as a percentage . its value depend on the frequency of radiation consider : unqualify , it usually refer to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light . in general , the albedo depend on the direction and directional distribution of incoming radiation . exception be lambertian surface , which scatter radiation in all direction in a cosine function , so their albedo do not depend on the incoming distribution . in realistic case , a bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( brdf) be require to characterize the scattering property of a surface accurately , although albedo be a very useful first approximation . terrestrial albedo albedos of typical material in visible light range from up to 90 % for fresh snow , to about 4 % for charcoal , one of the darkest substance . deeply shadow cavity can achieve an effective albedo approach the zero of a blackbody . when see from a distance , the ocean surface have a low albedo , as do most forest , while desert area have some of the highest albedo among landform . most land area be in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4 . albedo - from eric weisstein 's world of physics the average albedo of the earth be about 30 % . this be far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of cloud . human activity have change the albedo (via forest clearance and farming , for example ) of various area around the globe . however , quantification of this effect on the global scale be difficult . the classic example of albedo effect be the snow-temperature feedback . if a snow-covered area warm and the snow melt , the albedo decrease , more sunlight be absorb , and the temperature tend to increase . the converse be true : if snow form , a cool cycle happen . the intensity of the albedo effect depend on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation ; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics . the earth 's surface albedo be regularly estimate via earth observation satellite sensor such as nasa 's modis instrument onboard the terra and aqua satellite . as the total amount of reflect radiation cannot be directly measure by satellite , a mathematical model of the brdf be use to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurement into estimate of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance . ( e . g. , . ) the earth 's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect be currently about 15°c. for the frozen ( more reflective ) planet be the average temperature below -40°c ( if only all continent be completely cover by glacier - the mean temperature be about 0°c ) . the simulation for ( more absorptive ) aquaplanet show the average temperature close to 27°c . white-sky and black-sky albedo it have be show that for many application involve terrestrial albedo , the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle can reasonably be approximate by the proportionate sum of two term : the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle , , and the bi-hemispherical reflectance , the proportion concern be define as the proportion of diffuse illumination . albedo can then be give as : : directional-hemispherical reflectance be sometimes refer to as black-sky albedo and bi-hemispherical reflectance as white sky albedo . these term be important because they allow the albedo to be calculate for any give illumination condition from a knowledge of the intrinsic property of the surface . astronomical albedo the albedo of planet , satellite and asteroid can be use to infer much about their property . the study of albedo , their dependence on wavelength , light angle ( "phase angle " ) , and variation in time comprise a major part of the astronomical field of photometry . for small and far object that cannot be resolve by telescope , much of what we know come from the study of their albedo . for example , the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system object , the variation of albedo with phase angle give information about regolith property , while unusually high radar albedo be indicative of high metallic content in asteroid . enceladus , a moon of saturn , have one of the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system , with 99 % of em radiation reflect . another notable high albedo body be eris , with an albedo of 86 % . many object in the outer solar system wm . robert johnston ( 2008-09-17 ) .

( 8/97 ) tree because tree tend to have a low albedo , remove forest would tend to increase albedo and thereby could produce localize climate cool . cloud feedback further complicate the issue . in seasonally snow-covered zone , winter albedo of treeless area be 10 % to 50 % higher than nearby forest area because snow do not cover the tree as readily . deciduous tree have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 while coniferous tree have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15 . the difference between deciduous and coniferous be because coniferous tree be darker in general and have cone-shaped crown . the shape of these crown trap radiant energy more effectively than deciduous tree . study by the hadley centre have investigate the relative ( generally warm ) effect of albedo change and ( cooling ) effect of carbon sequestration on plant forest . they find that new forest in tropical and midlatitude area tend to cool ; new forest in high latitudes ( e .g . siberia ) be neutral or perhaps warm . snow snow albedo can be as high as 90 % ; this , however , be for the ideal example : fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape . over antarctica they average a little more than 80 % . if a marginally snow-covered area warm , snow tend to melt , lower the albedo , and hence lead to more snowmelt ( the ice-albedo positive feedback ) . water water reflect light very differently from typical terrestrial material . the reflectivity of a water surface be calculate use the fresnel equation ( see graph ) . reflectivity of smooth water at 20 c ( refractive index=1.333 ) at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water be always smooth so the light be reflect in a specular manner ( not diffusely ) . the glint of light off water be a commonplace effect of this . at small angle of incident light , waviness result in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increase average incident angle . although the reflectivity of water be very low at low and medium angle of incident light , it increase tremendously at high angle of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the earth near the terminator ( early morning , late afternoon and near the pole ) . however , as mention above , waviness cause an appreciable reduction . since the light specularly reflect from water do not usually reach the viewer , water be usually consider to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angle of incident light . note that white cap on wave look white ( and have high albedo ) because the water be foam up ( not smooth at the scale of the wavelength of light ) so the fresnel equation do not apply . fresh ‘black ’ ice exhibit fresnel reflection . clouds further information : cloud albedo clouds be another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation . different type of cloud have different albedo value , theoretically range from a minimum of near 0 % to a maximum in the high 70 . " on any give day , about half of earth be cover by cloud , which reflect more sunlight than land and water . clouds keep earth cool by reflect sunlight , but they can also serve as blanket to trap warmth . " baffle scientist say less sunlight reach earth | livescience albedo and climate in some area be already affect by artificial cloud , such as those create by the contrail of heavy commercial airliner traffic . a study follow the burning of the kuwaiti oil field by saddam hussein show that temperature under the burn oil fire be as much as 10 o c colder than temperature several mile away under clear sky . the kuwait oil fire as see by landsat aerosol effectsaerosol ( very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere ) have two effect , direct and indirect . the direct ( albedo ) effect be generally to cool the planet ; the indirect effect ( the particle act as ccns and thereby change cloud property ) be less certain . # 671 climate change 2001 : the scientific basis as per : aerosols can modify the earth’s radiative balance through the aerosol direct and indirect effect . * aerosol direct effect . aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation . the scattering of radiation cause atmospheric cooling , whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming . * aerosol indirect effect . aerosols modify the property of cloud through a subset of the aerosol population call cloud condensation nuclei (ccn) . increase ccn concentration lead to increase cloud droplet number concentration ( cdnc) . a greater number of cloud droplet lead to increase cloud albedo , increase light scattering and radiative cooling ( first indirect effect ) . increase cdnc also lead to reduced precipitation efficiency and increase lifetime of the cloud ( second indirect effect ) . black carbon another albedo-related effect on the climate be from black carbon particle . the size of this effect be difficult to quantify : the ipcc say that their "estimate of the global mean radiative force for bc aerosol from fossil fuel be ... +0.2 w m -2 ( from +0.1 w m -2 in the sar ) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 w m ... -2 " . climate change 2001 : the scientific basis see also * bond albedo * global dim * insolation * irradiance * polar see-saw * reflectivity * solar radiation managementreference goode , p. r. et al .

" " how have the evolutionary past of homo sapien influence its social organization and culture ? " and so forth . in the united states , contemporary anthropology be typically divide into four subfield : social/cultural anthropology , archaeology , linguistic anthropology and biological anthropology , and this division be reflect in many undergraduate textbook ( kottak , c ) as well as anthropology program ( e .g . michigan , berkeley , upenn , etc. ) . unlike the american system , however , at university in the united kingdom , and much of europe , the subfield be frequently house in separate department . layton , robert ( 1998 ) an introduction to theory in anthropology . cambridge : cambridge university press . the social/cultural subfield have be very influence by post-modern theory , and during the 1970 and 1980 , an epistemological shift away from the positivist tradition that have largely inform the discipline occur . geertz , behar , clifford & james during this shift , endure question about the nature and production of knowledge come to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology . as this be by far the most populous of the subfield , and as archaeology , biological anthropology , and , in many case , linguistic anthropology remain positivist , anthropology as a discipline have lack cohesion over the last several decade . this difference in epistemology have even lead to department diverge , perhaps most famously representative be that which occur in the 1998-9 academic year at stanford university under the leadership of condoleezza rice , where the “scientists ” and “non-scientists ” divide into two department : anthropology and cultural and social anthropology . stanford university bulletin 1998-1999 pg . 213 anthropology at stanford have since become reunify in the 2008-2009 academic year , stanford university bulletin 2007-2008 pg . 269 [ ] perhaps illustrate a grow trend to rethink the approach to anthropology . a brief overview of the discipline one traditional approach to simplify such a vast enterprise have be to divide anthropology into four subfield , each with its own further branch : biological or physical anthropology , social anthropology or cultural anthropology , archaeology and anthropological linguistics . citation need briefly put , biological or physical anthropology focus on the study of human population use an evolutionary framework . biological anthropologist who be interest in our past have most popularly theorized about how the globe have become populated with human ( "out of africa " and "multi-regional evoluation for example )as well as try to explain geographical human variation , also refer to as "race .

( this contrast with malinowski 's functionalism , and be quite different from the later french structuralism , which examine the conceptual structure in language and symbolism . ) malinowski and radcliffe-brown 's influence stem from the fact that they , like boas , actively train student and aggressively build up institution that further their programmatic ambition . this be particularly the case with radcliffe-brown , who spread his agenda for " social anthropology " by teach at university across the british commonwealth . from the late 1930 until the postwar period appear a string of monograph and edited volume that cement the paradigm of british social anthropology ( bsa ) . famous ethnography include the nuer , by edward evan evans-pritchard , and the dynamics of clanship among the tallensi , by meyer fortes ; well-known edited volume include african systems of kinship and marriage and african political systems . max gluckman , together with many of his colleague at the rhodes-livingstone institute and student at manchester university , collectively know as the manchester school , take bsa in new direction through their introduction of explicitly marxist-informed theory , their emphasis on conflict and conflict resolution , and their attention to the way in which individual negotiate and make use of the social structural possibility . in britain , anthropology have a great intellectual impact , it " contribute to the erosion of christianity , the growth of cultural relativism , an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life , and the replacement of diachronic mode of analysis with synchronic , all of which be central to modern culture .

( 1968 ) race , culture , and evolution : essays in the history of anthropology . london : the free press . many american anthropologist adopt his agenda for social reform , and theory of race continue to be popular subject for anthropologist today . the so-called " four field approach " have its origin in boasian anthropology , divide the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated field of sociocultural , biological , linguistic , and archaic anthropology ( i .e . , archaeology ) . anthropology in the united states continue to be deeply influence by the boasian tradition , especially its emphasis on culture . ruth benedict in 1937 boas use his position at columbia university and the american museum of natural history to train and develop multiple generation of student . his first generation of student include alfred kroeber , robert lowie , edward sapir and ruth benedict , who each produce richly detailed study of indigenous north american culture . they provide a wealth of detail use to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process . kroeber and sapir 's focus on native american language help establish linguistics as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on indo-european language . the publication of alfred kroeber 's textbook , anthropology , mark a turn point in american anthropology . after three decade of amassing material , boasian feel a grow urge to generalize . this be most obvious in the ' culture and personality 's study carry out by younger boasian such as margaret mead and ruth benedict . influence by psychoanalytic psychologist include sigmund freud and carl jung , these author seek to understand the way that individual personality be shape by the wider cultural and social force in which they grow up . though such work as come of age in samoa and the chrysanthemum and the sword remain popular with the american public , mead and benedict never have the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expect . boas have plan for ruth benedict to succeed he as chair of columbia 's anthropology department , but she be sideline by ralph linton , and mead be limit to she office at the amnh. anthropology in canada canadian anthropology begin , as in other part of the colonial world , as ethnological datum in the record of traveller and missionary . in canada , jesuit missionary such as father leclercq , le jeune and sagard , in the 1600 , provide the oldest ethnographic record of native tribe in what be then the domain of canada . true anthropology begin with a government department : the geological survey of canada , and george mercer dawson ( director in 1895 ) . dawson 's support for anthropology create impetus for the profession in canada . this be expand upon by prime minister wilfrid laurier , who establish a division of anthropology within the geological survey in 1910 . anthropologist be recruit from england and the usa , set the foundation for the unique canadian style of anthropology . scholar include the linguist and boasian edward sapir . anthropology in franceÉmile durkheim anthropology in france have a less clear genealogy than the british and american tradition , in part because many french writer influential in anthropology have be train or hold faculty position in sociology , philosophy , or other field rather than in anthropology . most commentator consider marcel mauss ( 1872-1950 ) , nephew of the influential sociologist Émile durkheim to be the founder of the french anthropological tradition . mauss belong to durkheim 's année sociologique group ; and while durkheim and other examine the state of modern society , mauss and his collaborator ( such as henri hubert and robert hertz ) draw on ethnography and philology to analyze society which be not as 'differentiated ' as european nation state . two work by mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance : essay on the gift a seminal analysis of exchange and reciprocity , and his huxley lecture on the notion of the person , the first comparative study of notion of person and selfhood cross-culturally . mauss , marcel ( 1938 ) " a category of the human mind : the notion of person ; the notion of self. , " in m. carrithers , s. collins , and s. lukes , ed . the category of the person : anthropology , philosophy , history . pp . 1-25 . cambridge/new york : cambridge university press . originally give as “ une categorie de l’esprit humain : la notion de personne , celle de ‘moi’ , ” for the huxley memorial lecture and appear in the journal of the royal anthropological institute , 68 . throughout the interwar year , french interest in anthropology often dovetail with wider cultural movement such as surrealism and primitivism which draw on ethnography for inspiration . marcel griaule and michel leiris be example of people who combine anthropology with the french avant-garde . during this time most of what be know as ethnologie be restrict to museum , such as the musée de l'homme found by paul rivet , and anthropology have a close relationship with study of folklore . above all , however , it be claude lévi-strauss who help institutionalize anthropology in france . in addition to the enormous influence his structuralism exert across multiple discipline , lévi-strauss establish tie with american and british anthropologist . at the same time he establish center and laboratory within france to provide an institutional context within anthropology while training influential student such as maurice godelier and françoise héritier who would prove influential in the world of french anthropology . much of the distinct character of france 's anthropology today be a result of the fact that most anthropology be carry out in nationally fund research laboratory ( cnr ) rather than academic department in university . other influential writer in the 1970 include pierre clastres , who explain in his book on the guayaki tribe in paraguay that "primitive society " actively oppose the institution of the state . therefore , these stateless society be not less evolve than society with state , but take the active choice of conjure the institution of authority as a separate function from society . the leader be only a spokesperson for the group when it have to deal with other group ( "international relation " ) but have no inside authority , and may be violently remove if he attempt to abuse this position . the most important french social theorist since foucault and lévi-strauss be pierre bourdieu , who train formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually hold the chair of sociology at the collège de france . like mauss and other before he , however , he work on topic both in sociology and anthropology . his fieldwork among the kabyles of algeria place he solidly in anthropology , while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in european society place he as solidly in sociology . other country anthropology in greece and portugal be much influence by british anthropology . citation need in greece , there be since the 19th century a science of the folklore call laographium ( laography ) , in the form of " a science of the interior" , although theoretically weak ; but the connotation of the field deeply change after world war ii , when a wave of anglo-american anthropologist introduce a science " of the outside" . geneviève zoïa , « l'anthropologie en grèce » , terrain , numéro 14—l'incroyable et se preuve ( mar 1990 ) , [en ligne] , mi en ligne le 7 octobre 2005 . url : consulté le 15 juin 2007 .

the austro-asiatic language be a large language family of southeast asia , and also scatter throughout india and bangladesh . the name come from the latin word for " south " and the greek name of asia , hence " south asia . " among these language , only vietnamese , khmer , and mon have a long establish record history , and only vietnamese and khmer have official status ( in vietnam and cambodia , respectively ) . the rest of the language be speak by minority group . ethnologue identify 168 austro-asiatic language . these be traditionally divide into two family , mon-khmer and munda , but two recent classification have abandon mon-khmer as a valid node , although this be tentative and not generally accept . austro-asiatic language have a disjunct distribution across india , bangladesh and southeast asia , separate by region where other language be speak . it be widely believe that the austro-asiatic language be the autochthonous language of southeast asia and the eastern indian subcontinent , and that the other language of the region , include the indo-european , kradai , dravidian and sino-tibetan language , be the result of later migration of people . there be , for example , austro-asiatic word in the tibeto-burman language of eastern nepal . some linguist have attempt to prove that austro-asiatic language be relate to austronesian language , thus form the austric superfamily . the austro-asiatic language be well know for have a " sesqui-syllabic " pattern , with basic noun and verb consist of a reduced minor syllable plus a full syllable . many of they also have infix . classification linguist traditionally recognize two primary division of austro-asiatic : the mon-khmer language of southeast asia , northeast india and the nicobar islands , and the munda language of east and central india and part of bangladesh . however , no evidence for this classification have ever be publish , and it be possible that the linguistic classification have be influence by researcher 's subjective perception of a racial dichotomy between the speaker of language that have traditionally be classify as mon-khmer and those that have traditionally be classify as munda . each of the family that be write in boldface type below be accept as a valid clade . however , the relationship between these family within austro-asiatic be debate ; in addition to the traditional classification , two recent proposal be give , neither of which accept traditional mon-khmer as a valid unit . it should be note that little of the datum use for compete classification have ever be publish , and therefore cannot be evaluate by peer review . gérard diffloth ( 2005)diffloth compare reconstruction of various clade , and attempt to classify they base on share innovation . as a schematic , we have : { | cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0 style = " " | style ="width :1.5em;border-bottom :1px solid black ; " valign=bottom align=center | austro- asiatic | | rowspan=2 | | - | valign=top | | } or in more detail , * munda language ( india ) :* koraput : 7 language :*core munda language : :* kharian-juang : 2 language : :*north munda language : : : korku : : : kherwarian : 12 language * khasi-khmuic language ( northern mon-khmer ) :* khasian : 3 language of eastern india and bangladesh :*palaungo-khmuic language : :* khmuic : 13 language of laos and thailand : :*palaungo-pakanic language : : : pakanic or palyu : 4 or 5 language of southern china and vietnam : : : palaungic : 21 language of burma , southern china , and thailand * nuclear mon-khmer language :* khmero-vietic language ( eastern mon-khmer ) : :* vieto-katuic language ?

the afroasiatic language constitute a language family with about 375 living language ( sil estimate ) and more than 350 million speaker spread throughout north africa , the horn of africa , and southwest asia , as well as part of the sahel , west africa and east africa . arabic be the most widespread afroasiatic language with over 280 million native speaker . #ppa27,m1 language of the world afroasiatic also include several ancient language , such as ancient egyptian , biblical hebrew , and akkadian . the term " afroasiatic " ( often now spell as afro-asiatic ) be coin by maurice delafosse ( 1914 ) . it do not come into general use until it be adopt by joseph greenberg ( 1950 ) to replace the earlier term " hamito-semitic" , follow his demonstration that hamitic be not a valid language family . the term " hamito-semitic " remain in use in the academic tradition of some european country , although some author have now replace it with " afrasian" , or , reflect an opinion that it be more african than asian , " afrasan " . individual scholar have call the family " erythraean " ( tucker 1966 ) and " lisramic " ( hodge 1972 ) . distribution and branchessome linguist 's proposal for group within afroasiatic the afroasiatic language family be usually consider to include the following branch : * berber * chadic * cushitic * egyptian * omotic * semitic while there be general agreement on these six family , there be some point of disagreement among linguist who study afroasiatic . in particular : * omotic be the most controversial member of afroasiatic since the grammatical formative " to which afroasiaticist have tend to attach the greatest importance be either absent or distinctly wobbly " ( hayward 1995 ) . greenberg ( 1963 ) and other consider it a subgroup of cushitic , while other have raise doubt about it be part of afroasiatic at all ( e .g . theil 2006 ) . * the afroasiatic identity of ongota be broadly question , as be its position within afroasiatic among those who accept it , due to the "mixed " appearance of the language and a paucity of research and datum . harold fleming ( 2006 ) propose that ongota constitute a separate branch of afroasiatic . {haupt_harrassowitz= } sands ( 2009 ) believe the most convincing proposal be savà & tosco ( 2003 ) , that ongota be east cushitic with a nilo-saharan substratum . in other word , the ongota would appear to have once speak a nilo-saharan language but then shift to speak a cushitic language , while retain some characteristic of their earlier nilo-saharan language . * beja be sometimes list as a separate branch of afroasiatic but be more often include in the cushitic branch , which have a high degree of internal diversity . * whether the various branch of cushitic actually form a language family be sometimes question , but not their inclusion in afroasiatic itself . * there be no consensus on the interrelationship of the five non-omotic branch of afroasiatic ( see " overview of classification " below ) . this situation be not unusual , even among long-established language family : there be also many disagreement concern the internal classification of the indo-european language , for instance . classification history medieval scholar sometimes link two or more branch of afroasiatic together . as early as the 9th century , the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret in algeria perceive a relationship between berber and semitic . he know of semitic through arabic , hebrew , and aramaic . in the course of the 19th century , europeans also begin suggest such relationship . in 1844 , theodor benfey suggest a language family consist of semitic , berber , and cushitic ( call the latter "ethiopic" ) . in the same year , t.n. newman suggest a relationship between semitic and hausa , but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty . friedrich müller name the traditional " hamito-semitic " family in 1876 in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft . he define it as consist of a semitic group plus a " hamitic " group contain egyptian , berber , and cushitic ; he exclude the chadic group . these classification rely in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial argument ( see hamitic hypothesis ) . leo reinisch ( 1909 ) propose link cushitic and chadic , while urge a more distant affinity to egyptian and semitic , thus foreshadow greenberg , but his suggestion find little resonance . marcel cohen ( 1924 ) reject the idea of a distinct hamitic subgroup and include hausa ( a chadic language ) in his comparative hamito-semitic vocabulary . joseph greenberg ( 1950 ) strongly confirm cohen 's rejection of " hamitic" , add ( and sub-classified ) the chadic branch , and propose the new name " afroasiatic " for the family . nearly all scholar have accept greenberg 's classification . in 1969 , harold fleming propose that what have previously be know as western cushitic be an independent branch of afroasiatic , suggest for it the new name omotic . this proposal and name have meet with widespread acceptance . several scholar , include harold fleming and robert hetzron , have since question the traditional inclusion of beja in cushitic . subgroup little agreement exist on the subgrouping of the five or six branch of afroasiatic : semitic , egyptian , berber , chadic , cushitic , and omotic ( if omotic be not include in cushitic ) . however , christopher ehret ( 1979 ) , harold fleming ( 1981 ) , and joseph greenberg ( 1981 ) all agree that the omotic branch split from the rest first . otherwise : * paul newman ( 1980 ) group berber with chadic and egyptian with semitic , while question the inclusion of omotic in afroasiatic . rolf theil ( 2006 ) concur with the exclusion of omotic , but do not otherwise address the structure of the family . * harold fleming ( 1981 ) divide non-omotic afroasiatic , or " erythraean" , into three group , cushitic , semitic , and chadic-berber-egyptian . he later add semitic and beja to chadic-berber-egyptian and tentatively propose ongota as a new third branch of erythraean . he thus divide afroasiatic into two major branch , omotic and erythraean , with erythraean consist of three sub-branch , cushitic , chadic-berber-egyptian-semitic-beja , and ongota . * vladimir orel and olga stolbova ( 1995 ) group berber with semitic and chadic with egyptian . they split up cushitic into five or more independent branch of afroasiatic , view cushitic as a sprachbund rather than a language family . * christopher ehret ( 1995 ) group egyptian , berber , and semitic together in a " north afro-asiatic " subgroup . * igor m. diakonoff ( 1996 ) subdivide afroasiatic in two , group berber , cushitic , and semitic together as east-west afrasian ( esa ) , and chadic with egyptian as north-south afrasian ( nsa ) . he exclude omotic from afroasiatic . * lionel bender ( 1997 ) group berber , cushitic , and semitic together as " macro-cushitic" . he regard chadic and omotic as the branch of afroasiatic most remote from the other . * alexander militarev ( 2000 ) , on the basis of lexicostatistic , group berber with chadic and both more distantly with semitic , as against cushitic and omotic . position among the world 's language afroasiatic be one of the four language family of africa identify by joseph greenberg in his book the languages of africa ( 1963 ) . it be the only one that extend outside of africa , via the semitic branch . there be no generally accept relation between afroasiatic and any other language family . however , several proposal group afroasiatic with one or more other language family have be make . the best-known of these be the follow : * hermann möller ( 1906 ) argue for a relation between semitic and the indo-european language . this proposal be accept by some linguist ( e .g . holger pedersen and louis hjelmslev ) but have little currency today . * apparently influence by möller ( a colleague of his at the university of copenhagen ) , holger pedersen include hamito-semitic ( the term replace by afroasiatic ) in his proposed nostratic language family ( cf . pedersen 1931:336-338 ) , which also include the indo-european , finno-ugric , samoyed , turkish , mongolian , manchu , and yukaghir language . this inclusion be retain by subsequent nostraticist , start with vladislav illich-svitych and aharon dolgopolsky . like all aspect of the nostratic hypothesis , it be highly controversial . citation need * joseph greenberg ( 2000-2002 ) do not reject a relationship of afroasiatic to these other language , but he consider it more distantly relate to they than they be to each other , group instead these other language in a separate language family , which he call eurasiatic , and to which he add chukotian , gilyak , korean , japanese-ryukyuan , eskimo-aleut , and ainu . origins and common feature further information : proto-afroasiatic language and afroasiatic urheimat common feature of the afroasiatic language include : * a two-gender system in the singular , with the feminine mark by the /t/ sound * vso typology with svo tendency * a set of emphatic consonant , variously realize as glottalize , pharyngealize , or implosive * a templatic morphology in which word inflect by internal change as well as with prefix and suffix all afroasiatic subfamily show evidence of a causative affix s , but a similar suffix also appear in other group , such as the niger-congo language . semitic , berber , cushitic ( include beja ) , and chadic support possessive suffix . tonal language appear in the omotic , chadic , and cushitic branch of afroasiatic , accord to ehret ( 1996 ) . the semitic , berber , and egyptian branch do not use tone phonemically . cognate some important afroasiatic cognate be : *b-n- 'build ' ( ehret : *bĭn ) , attest in chadic , semitic ( *bny ) , cushitic ( *mĭn/*măn 'house ' ) , berber ( *bn ) and omotic ( dime bin- 'build ,

" napoleon abuse his power , make life harder for the animal ; the pig impose more control while reserve privilege for themselves . the pig rewrite history , villainize snowball and glorify napoleon . squealer justify every statement napoleon make , even the pig 's alteration of the seven commandment of animalism . " no animal shall drink alcohol " be change to " no animal shall drink alcohol to excess " when the pig discover the farmer 's whisky . " beast of england " be ban as inappropriate , as accord to napoleon the dream of animal farm have be realize . it be replace by an anthem glorify napoleon , who appear to be adopt the lifestyle of a man . the animal , though cold , starve , and overworked , remain convinced through psychological conditioning that they be better off than they be when rule by mr. jones . squealer abuse the animal 's poor memory and invent number to show their improvement . mr. frederick , one of the neighbouring farmer , swindle napoleon by buy old wood with forged money , and then attack the farm , use blast powder to blow up the restore windmill . though the animal win the battle , they do so at great cost , as many , include boxer , be wound . boxer continue work harder and harder , until he collapse while work on the windmill . napoleon send for a van to take boxer to the veterinarian , explain that better care can be give there . benjamin notice that the van belong to " alfred simmonds , horse slaughterer and glue boiler" , and attempt to mount a rescue ; but the animal 's attempt be futile . squealer report that the van be purchase by the hospital and the writing from the previous owner have not be repaint . he recount a tale of boxer 's death in the hand of the best medical care . in reality , the pig send boxer to his death in exchange for money to buy more whisky . year pass , and the pig learn to walk upright , carry whip , and wear clothes . the seven commandment be reduce to a single phrase : " all animal be equal , but some animal be more equal than other . " napoleon hold a dinner party for the pig and the human of the area , who congratulate napoleon on have the hardest-working animal in the country on the least feed . napoleon announce an alliance with the human , against the labouring class of both "worlds " . he abolish practice and tradition relate to the revolution , and revert the name of the farm to " manor farm" . the animal , overhear the conversation , notice that the face of the pig have begin change . during a poker match , an argument break out between napoleon and mr pilkington when they both play the ace of spades , and the animal realize that the face of the pig look like the face of human and no one can tell the difference between they . animalism animalism be an allegorical mirror of the soviet union , particularly between the 1910 and the 1940 , as well as the evolution of the view of the russian revolutionary and government of how to practice it . it be invent by the highly respected pig old major . the pig snowball , napoleon , and squealer adapt old major 's idea into an actual philosophy , which they formally name animalism . soon after , napoleon and squealer indulge in the vice of human ( drinking alcohol , sleep in bed , trading ) . squealer be employ to alter the seven commandment to account for his humanization , which represent the soviet government 's tweaking of communist theory to make it more a reformation of capitalism than a replacement . the seven commandments be law that be suppose to keep order and ensure elementary animalism within animal farm . the seven commandment be design to unite the animal together against the human and prevent animal from follow the human 's evil habit . since not all of the animal can remember they , they be boil down into one basic statement : " four leg good , two leg bad ! " ( with wing count as leg for this purpose , snowball argue that wing count as leg as they be object of propulsion rather than manipulation ) , which the sheep constantly repeat , distract the crowd from the lie of the pig . the original commandment be : # whatever go upon two leg be an enemy # whatever go upon four leg , or have wing , be a friend . # no animal shall wear clothes . # no animal shall sleep in a bed . # no animal shall drink alcohol . # no animal shall kill any other animal . # all animal be equal . later , napoleon and his pig be corrupt by the absolute power they hold over the farm . to maintain their popularity with the other animal , squealer secretly paint addition to some commandment to benefit the pig while keep they free of accusation of break the law ( such as " no animal shall drink alcohol " have " to excess " append to it and " no animal shall sleep in a bed " with " with sheet " add to it ) . eventually the law be replace with " all animal be equal , but some animal be more equal than other " , and " four leg good , two leg better ! " as the pig become more human . character the event and character in animal farm satirise communism ( " animalism" ) , authoritarian government and human gullibility generally ; snowball be see as leon trotsky and the head pig , napoleon , be stalin . pig ; old major : a prize middle white boar be the inspiration that fuel the rebellion in the book . he be 12 year old . accord to one interpretation , he could be base upon both karl marx , founder of modern marxism and the base for communism , ( in that he describe the ideal society the animal could create if the human be overthrown ) and vladimir lenin ( in that his skull be put on revered public display , as be lenin 's embalmed corpse ) . however , accord to christopher hitchens : " the person of lenin and trotsky be combine into one [i .e . , snowball] , or , it might even be [ ...] to say , there be no lenin at all .

a modest proposal : for prevent the child of poor people in ireland from be a burden to their parent or country , and for make them beneficial to the publick , commonly refer to as a modest proposal , be a juvenalian satirical essay write and publish anonymously by jonathan swift in 1729 . swift appear to suggest in his essay that the impoverished irish might ease their economic trouble by sell child as food for rich gentleman and lady . by do this he mock the authority of the british official . this be when britain have take over ireland and put heavy restriction on their trade , stifle their economy . the essay have be note by historian as be the first document satirical essay . detail swift go to great length to support his argument , include a list of possible preparation style for the child , and calculation show the financial benefit of his suggestion . he use common method of argument throughout his essay , such as appeal to the authority of " a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london " and " the famous psalmanazar , a native of the island formosa " ( who have already confess to not be from formosa in 1706 ) . swift couch his argument in then-current event , exploit common prejudice against catholics ( misnomed papist ) and point out their depredation of england . after enumerate the benefit of his proposal , swift address possible objection include the depopulation of ireland and a litany of other solution which he dismiss as impractical . this essay be widely hold to be one of the greatest example of sustained irony in the history of the english language . much of its shock value derive from the fact that the first portion of the essay describe the plight of starve beggar in ireland , so that the reader be unprepared for the surprise of swift 's solution when he state , " a young healthy child well nurse , be , at a year old , a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food , whether stew , roast , bake , or boil ; and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee , or a ragout . " reader unacquainted with its reputation as a satirical work often do not immediately realize that swift be not seriously propose cannibalism and infanticide , nor would reader unfamiliar with the satire of horace and juvenal recognize that swift 's essay follow the rule and structure of latin satire . the satirical element of the pamphlet be often only understand after the reader note the allusion make by swift to the attitude of landlord , such as the following : " i grant this food may be somewhat dear , and therefore very proper for landlords , who as they have already devour most of the parent , seem to have the best title to the child . " swift extend the metaphor to get in a few jibe at england’s mistreatment of ireland , note that " for this kind of commodity will not bear exportation , and flesh be of too tender a consistence , to admit a long continuance in salt , although perhaps i could name a country , which would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it . " in the tradition of roman satire , swift introduce the reform he be actually suggest by deride they : therefore let no man talk to i of other expedient : of tax our absentee at five shilling a pound : of use neither clothes , nor household furniture , except what be of our own growth and manufacture : of utterly reject the material and instrument that promote foreign luxury : of cure the expensiveness of pride , vanity , idleness , and gaming in our woman : of introduce a vein of parsimony , prudence and temperance : of learn to love our country , wherein we differ even from laplander , and the inhabitant of topinamboo : of quit our animosity and faction , nor act any longer like the jews , who be murder one another at the very moment their city be take : of be a little cautious not to sell our country and conscience for nothing : of teach landlord to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenant . lastly , of put a spirit of honesty , industry , and skill into our shop-keeper , who , if a resolution could now be take to buy only our native goods , would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon we in the price , the measure , and the goodness , nor could ever yet be bring to make one fair proposal of just deal , though often and earnestly invite to it . therefore i repeat , let no man talk to i of these and the like expedient , 'till he have at least some glympse of hope , that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put they into practice . population solution it have be argue wittkowsky , swift’s modest proposal , p76 that swift’s main target in a modest proposal be not the condition in ireland , but rather the can-do spirit of the time that lead people to devise a number of illogical scheme that would purportedly solve social and economic ill . swift be especially insult by project that try to fix population and labor issue with a simple cure-all solution . wittkowsky , swift’s modest proposal , p85 a memorable example of these sort of scheme "involved the idea of run the poor through a joint-stock company " . in response , swift’s modest proposal be " a burlesque of project concern the poor " , wittkowsky , swift’s modest proposal , p88 that be in vogue during the early 18th century . a modest proposal also target the calculating way people perceive the poor in design their project . the pamphlet target reformer who "regard people as commodity " . wittkowsky , swift’s modest proposal , p101 in the piece , swift adopt the "technique of a political arithmetician " wittkowsky , swift’s modest proposal , p95 to show the utter ridiculousness of try to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics . critic differ about swift’s intention in use this faux-mathematical philosophy . edmund wilson argue that statistically " the logic of the ' modest proposal ' can be compare with defense of crime (arrogated to marx ) in which he argue that crime take care of the superfluous population " . wittkowsky counter that swift 's satiric use of statistical analysis be an effort to enhance his satire that " spring from a spirit of bitter mockery , not from the delight in calculation for their own sake" . wittkowsky , swift’s modest proposal , p98 rhetoric charles k. smith argue that swift’s rhetorical style persuade the reader to detest the speaker and pity the irish . swift’s specific strategy be twofold , use a " trap " lewis 135 to create sympathy for the irish and a dislike of the narrator who , in the span of one sentence , "details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grind poverty " but feel emotion solely for member of his own class . smith , toward a participatory rhetoric , p136 swift’s use of grip detail of poverty and his narrator’s cool approach towards they create " two oppose point of view " which "alienate the reader , perhaps unconsciously , from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy ' detachment a subject that swift have direct we , rhetorically , to see in a much less detached way " . lewis 136 swift have his proposer further degrade the irish by use language ordinarily reserve for animal . lewis argue that the speaker use " the vocabulary of animal husbandry " lewis 138 to describe the irish . once the child have be commoditize , swift’s rhetoric can easily turn "people into animal , then meat , and from meat , logically , into tonnage worth a price per pound " . swift use the proposer’s serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal . in make his argument , the speaker use the conventional , text book approve order of argument from swift’s time . lewis 139 the contrast between the " careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme " and " the ridiculousness of the proposal " create a situation in which the reader have " to consider just what pervert value and assumption would allow such a diligent , thoughtful , and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan " . tertullian’s apology some scholar have argue that a modest proposal be largely influence and inspire by tertullian’s apology . while tertullian’s apology be a satirical attack against early roman persecution of christianity , swift’s a modest proposal address the anglo-irish situation in the 1720 . james william johnson believe that swift see major similarity between the two situation . johnson , tertullian and a modest proposal , p563 johnson note swift’s obvious affinity for tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarity between the work a modest proposal and apology . johnson , tertullian and a modest proposal , p562 in structure , johnson point out the same central theme ; that of cannibalism and the eating of baby ; and the same final argument ; that "human depravity be such that man will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accuse their victim of be lower than human " . stylistically , swift and tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language . in agreement with johnson , donald c. baker point out the similarity between both author 's tone and use of irony . baker note the uncanny way that both author imply an ironic " justification by ownership " over the subject of sacrifice child tertullian while attack pagan parent , and swift while attack the english mistreatment of the irish poor . baker , tertullian and swift 's a modest proposal , p219 economic theme robert phiddian 's article " have you eat yet ? the reader in a modest proposal " focus on two aspect of a modest proposal : the voice of swift and the voice of the proposer . phiddian stress that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satiric voice of jonathan swift and the apparent economic projection of the proposer . he remind reader that " there be a gap between the narrator’s meaning and the text’s , and that a moral-political argument be be carry out by means of parody " . phiddian , have you eaten yet ? , p6 while swift’s proposal be obviously not a serious economic proposal , george wittkowsky , author of " swift’s modest proposal : the biography of an early georgian pamphlet" , argue that it in order to fully understand the piece , it be important to understand the economics of swift’s time . wittowsky argue that not enough critic have take the time to directly focus on the mercantilism and theory of labor in 18th century england . "[i]f one regard the modest proposal simply as a criticism of condition , about all one can say be that condition be bad and that swift 's irony brilliantly underscore this fact " . phiddian , have you eaten yet ? , p3 at the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century , it be believe that "people be the riches of the nation " , and there be a general faith in an economy which pay its worker low wages because high wages would mean worker would work less . phiddian , have you eaten yet ? , p4 furthermore , "in the mercantilist view no child be too young to go into industry " . in those time , the " somewhat more humane attitude of an earlier day have all but disappear and the laborer have come to be regard as a commodity" . people be the riches of a nation louis a. landa present swift’s a modest proposal as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the eighteenth century that "people be the riches of a nation " . landa , a modest proposal and populousness , p161 swift present the dire state of ireland and show that mere population itself , in ireland’s case , do not always mean greater wealth and economy . landa , a modest proposal and populousness , p165 the uncontrolled maxim fail to take into account that a person that do not produce in an economic or political way make a country poorer , not richer . swift also recognize the implication of such a fact in make mercantilist philosophy a paradox : the wealth of a country be base on the poverty of the majority of its citizen . swift however , landa argue , be not merely criticizing economic maxim but also address the fact that england be deny irish citizen their natural rights and dehumanize they by view they as a mere commodity . modern usage a modest proposal be include in many literature program as an example of early modern western satire . it also serve as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language , lend itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay course . outside of the realm of english study , a modest proposal be a relevant piece include in many comparative and global literature and history course , as well as those of numerous other discipline in the art , humanities , and even the social science . it have be emulate many time as well . in his book a modest proposal ( 1984 ) , evangelical author frank schaeffer emulate swift 's work in social conservative polemic against abortion and euthanasia in a future dystopia that advocate recycling of aborted embryo and fetus , as well as some disabled infant with compound intellectual , physical and physiological difficulty . ( such baby doe rules case be then a major concern of the pro-life movement of the early 1980s , which view selective treatment of those infant as disability discrimination . ) in hunter s. thompson 's fear and loathing in america : the brutal odyssey of an outlaw journalist , which contain hundred of private letter write by thompson over the year , contain a letter in which he use a modest proposal 's satire technique against the vietnam war . thompson write a letter to a local aspen newspaper inform they that , on christmas eve , he be go to use napalm to burn a number of dog and hopefully any human they find . this letter protest the burning of vietnamese people occur overseas . in popular culture the game orphan feast on cartoon network 's adult swim website be loosely base on a modest proposal . the show sealab 2021 reference a modest proposal by the character of jodene sparks . it be suggest as recommended reading when debbie want a child . a modest proposal be the name of the university of texas at dallas 's alternative student newspaper , the monthly opinion paper of the university . a modest proposal be mention in the 1996 film the birdcage . controversial american political activist and disbar attorney jack thompson 's a modest video game proposal draw its title from a modest proposal . one of the radio presenter in the game saint 's row claim he have " a modest proposal " which be to apply shock collar to all immigrant in america . note reference * baker , donald c ( 1957 ) , [ , tertullian and swift 's a modest proposal } } } } { { #if : |{ { #if : | : ] , doi : 10.2307/2707237 external links * a modest proposal ( gutenberg ) * free audiobook from librivox * a modest proposal bbc radio 4 in our time with melvyn bragg sir john tenniel 's illustration of the caterpillar for lewis carroll 's alice 's adventure in wonderland be note for its ambiguous central figure , whose head can be view as be a human male 's face with a pointed nose and pointy chin or be the head end of an actual caterpillar , with the right three " true " leg visible .

" mean " hereby refer to whatever should be capture by a good dictionary . for instance , the word “bank ” have several distinct lexical definition , include “financial institution ” and “edge of a river” . another example be as in apothecary . you could say " i buy herb from the apothecary . " this could mean you actually speak to the apothecary ( pharmacist ) or go to the apothecary ( drug store ) . the context in which an ambiguous word be use often make it evident which of the meaning be intend . if , for instance , someone say “ i deposit $ 100 in the bank , ” most people would not think you use a shovel to dig in the mud . however , some linguistic context do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word . for example , " biweekly " can mean "fortnightly " (once every two week - 26 time a year ) , or " twice a week " ( 104 time a year ) . if "biweekly " be use in a conversation about a meeting schedule , it may be difficult to infer which meaning be intend . many people who ? believe that such lexically ambiguous , miscommunication-prone word should be avoid wherever possible , since the user generally have to waste time , effort , and attention span to define what be mean when they be use . the use of multi-defined word require the author or speaker to clarify their context , and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning ( in which case , a less ambiguous term should have be use ) . the goal of clear concise communication be that the receiver( s ) have no misunderstanding about what be mean to be convey . an exception to this could include a politician whose "wiggle word " and obfuscation be necessary to gain support from multiple constituent with mutually exclusive conflicting desire from their candidate of choice . ambiguity be a powerful tool of political science . more problematic be word whose senses express closely relate concept . “good , ” for example , can mean “useful” or “functional” ( that’s a good hammer ) , “exemplary ” ( she’s a good student ) , “pleasing ” ( this be good soup ) , “moral” ( a good person versus the lesson to be learn from a story ) , "righteous" , etc . “ i have a good daughter ” be not clear about which sense be intend . the various way to apply prefix and suffix can also create ambiguity ( “unlockable ” can mean “capable of be unlocked ” or “impossible to lock” ) . syntactic ambiguity arise when a complex phrase or a sentence can be parse in more than one way . “ he eat the cookie on the couch , ” for example , could mean that he eat those cookie which be on the couch ( as oppose to those that be on the table ) , or it could mean that he be sit on the couch when he eat the cookie . spoken language can contain many more type of ambiguity , where there be more than one way to compose a set of sound into word , for example “ice cream” and “ i scream . ” such ambiguity be generally resolve accord to the context . a mishearing of such , base on incorrectly resolve ambiguity , be call a mondegreen . semantic ambiguity arise when a word or concept have an inherently diffuse meaning base on widespread or informal usage . this be often the case , for example , with idiomatic expression whose definition be rarely or never well-defined , and be present in the context of a larger argument that invite a conclusion . for example , “you could do with a new automobile . how about a test drive ? ” the clause “you could do with ” present a statement with such wide possible interpretation as to be essentially meaningless . citation need lexical ambiguity be contrast with semantic ambiguity . the former represent a choice between a finite number of know and meaningful context-dependent interpretation . the latter represent a choice between any number of possible interpretation , none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning . this form of ambiguity be closely relate to vagueness . linguistic ambiguity can be a problem in law ( see ambiguity ( law ) ) , because the interpretation of write document and oral agreement be often of paramount importance . intentional applicationphilosopher ( and other user of logic ) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and remove ( or intentionally add ) ambiguity in argument , because it can lead to incorrect conclusion and can be use to deliberately conceal bad argument . for example , a politician might say “ i oppose tax that hinder economic growth . ” some will think he oppose tax in general , because they hinder economic growth . other may think he oppose only those tax that he believe will hinder economic growth . in writing , the correct insertion or omission of a comma after “taxes ” and the use of "which " can help reduce ambiguity here ( for the first meaning , “ , which ” be properly use in place of “that” ) , or the sentence can be restructure to completely eliminate possible misinterpretation . the devious politician hope that each constituent ( politics ) will interpret the above statement in the most desirable way , and think the politician support everyone 's opinion . however , the opposite can also be true - an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one , if the speaker use ambiguity ( intentionally or not ) . the logical fallacy of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous word and phrase . in literature and rhetoric , on the other hand , ambiguity can be a useful tool . groucho marx’s classic joke depend on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor , for example : “last night i shoot an elephant in my pajamas . what he be do in my pajamas i’ll never know . ” ambiguity can also be use as a comic device through a genuine intention to confuse , as do magic : the gathering 's unhinged © ambiguity , which make pun with homophone , mispunctuation , and run-on : “ whenever a player play a spell that counter a spell that have be played[ , ] or a player play a spell that come into play with counter , that player may counter the next spell played[ , ] or put an additional counter on a permanent that have already be play , but not counter . ” songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous word for artistic effect , as in the song title “don’t it make my brown eyes blue ” ( where “blue ” can refer to the color , or to sadness ) . in narrative , ambiguity can be introduce in several way : motive , plot , character . f. scott fitzgerald use the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel the great gatsby . all religion debate the orthodoxy or heterodoxy of ambiguity . christianity and judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with 'ambiguity ' . ambiguity within christianity live with ambiguity ( and other religion ) be resist by the conservative and fundamentalist , who regard the concept as equate with 'contradiction ' . non-fundamentalist christians and jews endorse rudolf otto 's description of the sacred as 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans' , the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinate human . metonymy involve the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation , or jargon , for the name of the whole object ( for example "wheels " to refer to a car , or "flowers " to refer to beautiful offspring , an entire plant , or a collection of bloom plant ) . in modern vocabulary critical semiotic , csi : sim8 metonymy encompass any potentially ambiguous word substitution that be base on contextual contiguity ( locate close together ) , or a function or process that an object perform , such as " sweet ride " to refer to a nice car . metonym miscommunication be consider a primary mechanism of linguistic humour . veale , tony ( 2003 ) : " metaphor and metonymy : the cognitive trump-cards of linguistic humor " psychology and management in sociology and social psychology , the term "ambiguity " be use to indicate situation that involve uncertainty . an increase amount of research be concentrate on how people react and respond to ambiguous situation . much of this focus on ambiguity tolerance . a number of correlation have be find between an individual’s reaction and tolerance to ambiguity and a range of factor . apter and desselles ( 2001 ) in motivational styles in everyday life : a guide to reversal theory . m.j. apter (ed ) ( 2001 ) apa book for example , find a strong correlation with such attribute and factor like a greater preference for safe as oppose to risk-based sport , a preference for endurance-type activity as oppose to explosive activity , a more organize and less casual lifestyle , greater care and precision in description , a lower sensitivity to emotional and unpleasant word , a less acute sense of humor , engage a smaller variety of sexual practice than their more risk-comfortable colleague , a lower likelihood of the use of drug , pornography and drink , a greater likelihood of display obsessional behavior . in the field of leadership david wilkinson ( 2006 ) wilkinson , d.j. ( 2006 ) the ambiguity advantage : what great leader be great at . new york palgrave macmillan . find strong correlation between an individual leader 's reaction to ambiguous situation and the modes of leadership they use , the type of creativity ( kirton ( 2003 ) kirton , m.j. ( 2003)adaption-innovation : in the context of diversity and change . routledge . and how they relate to other . music in music , piece or section which confound expectation and may be or be interpret simultaneously in different way be ambiguous , such as some polytonality , polymeter , other ambiguous meter or rhythm , and ambiguous phrasing , or ( stein 2005 , p . 79 ) any aspect of music . the music of africa be often purposely ambiguous . to quote sir donald francis tovey ( 1935 , p . 195 ) , “theorists be apt to vex themselves with vain effort to remove uncertainty just where it have a high aesthetic value . ” visual art the necker cube , an ambiguous image . in visual art , certain image be visually ambiguous , such as the necker cube , which can be interpret in two way . perception of such object remain stable for a time , then may flip , a phenomenon call multistable perception . the opposite of such ambiguous image be impossible object . picture or photograph may also be ambiguous at the semantic level : the visual image be unambiguous , but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous : be a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear , for instance ? construct language some language have be create with the intention of avoid ambiguity , especially lexical ambiguity . lojban and loglan be two related language which have be create with this in mind . the language can be both speak and write . these language be intend to provide a greater technical precision over big natural language , although historically , such attempt at language improvement have be criticize . language compose from many diverse source contain much ambiguity and inconsistency . the many exception to syntax and semantic rule be time-consuming and difficult to learn . this message box be use an invalid "type=move " parameter and need fix . mathematical notationmathematical notation , widely use in physics and other science , avoid many ambiguity compare to expression in natural language . however , for various reason , several lexical , syntactic and semantic ambiguity remain . name of function the ambiguity in the style of write a function should not be confuse with a multivalued function , which can ( and should ) be define in a deterministic and unambiguous way . several special function still do not have establish notation . usually , the conversion to another notation require to scale the argument and/or the result value ; sometimes , the same name of the function be use , cause confusion . example of such underestablished function : * sinc function * elliptic integral of the third kind ; translate elliptic integral form maple to mathematica , one should replace the second argument to its square , see ; deal with complex value , this may cause problem . * exponential integral , m.abramovits , i.stegun . handbook on mathematical function page 228 * hermite polynomial , page 775 expression ambiguous expression often appear in physical and mathematical text . it be common practice to omit multiplication sign in mathematical expression . also , it be common , to give the same name to a variable and a function , for example , . then , if one see , there be no way to distinguish , do it mean multiplied by , or function evaluate at argument equal to . in each case of use of such notation , the reader be suppose to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning . creator of algorithmic language try to avoid ambiguity . many algorithmic language ( c++ , matlab , fortran ) require the character * as symbol of multiplication . the language mathematica allow the user to omit the multiplication symbol , but require square bracket to indicate the argument of a function ; square bracket be not allow for grouping of expression . fortran , in addition , do not allow use of the same name ( identifier ) for different object , for example , function and variable ; in particular , the expression f=f( x ) be qualify as an error . the order of operation may depend on the context . in most programming language , the operation of division and multiplication have equal priority and be execute from leave to right . until the last century , many editorial assume that multiplication be perform first , for example , be interpret as ; in this case , the insertion of parenthesis be require when translate the formula to an algorithmic language . in addition , it be common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis , which also may lead to ambiguity . sometimes , one use italics letter to denote elementary function . in the scientific journal style , the expression means product of variable , , and , although in a slideshow , it may mean . comma in subscript and superscript sometimes be omit ; it be also ambiguous notation . if it be write , the reader should guess from the context , do it mean a single-index object , evaluate while the subscript be equal to product of variable , and , or it be indication to a three-valent tensor . the writing of instead of may mean that the writer either be stretch in space ( for example , to reduce the publication fee , or aim to increase number of publication without consider reader . the same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notation . subscript be also use to denote the argument to a function , as in . example of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expression , which could be understand to mean either or . in addition , may mean , as mean ( see tetration ) . , which by convention means , though it might be think to mean since means . , which arguably should mean but would commonly be understand to mean notation in quantum optics and quantum mechanic it be common to define the coherent state in quantum optics with and state with fixed number of photon with . then , there be an "unwritten rule " : the state be coherent if there be more greek character than latin character in the argument , and photon state if the latin character dominate . the ambiguity become even worse , if be use for the state with certain value of the coordinate , and mean the state with certain value of the momentum , which may be use in book on quantum mechanic . such ambiguity easy lead to confusion , especially if some normalized adimensional , dimensionless variable be use . expression may mean a state with single photon , or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1 , or state with momentum equal to unity , and so on . the reader be suppose to guess from the context . ambiguous term in physics and mathematics some physical quantity do not yet have establish notation ; their value ( and sometimes even dimension , as in the case of the einstein coefficient ) depend on the system of notation . many term be ambiguous . each use of an ambiguous term should be precede by the definition , suitable for a specific case . a highly confusing term be gain . for example , the sentence " the gain of a system should be double " , without context , mean close to nothing . it may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be double . it may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be double . it may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be double , for example , double the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system ( assume negligible absorption of the ground-state ) . the term intensity be ambiguous when apply to light . the term can refer to any of irradiance , luminous intensity , radiant intensity , or radiance , depend on the background of the person use the term . also , confusion may be relate with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of a dopant , or resolution of an imaging system , as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolve at the background of statistical noise . see also accuracy and precision and its talk . the berry paradox arise as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of term such as "definable " or "nameable " . term of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacy . other term with this type of ambiguity be : satisfiable , true , false , function , property , class , relation , cardinal , and ordinal . russell/ whitehead , principia mathematica mathematical interpretation of ambiguitythe necker cube and impossible cube , an underdetermined and overdetermined object , respectively . in mathematics and logic , ambiguity can be consider to be an underdetermined system ( of equation or logic ) – for example , leave open what the value of x be – while its opposite be a self-contradiction , also call inconsistency , paradoxicalness , or oxymoron , in an overdetermined system – such as , which have no solution – see also underdetermination . logical ambiguity and self-contradiction be analogous to visual ambiguity and impossible object , such as the necker cube and impossible cube , or many of the drawing of m. c. escher . goldstein , laurence ( 1996 ) , [ , reflexivity , contradiction , paradox and m. c. escher } } } } { { #if : the mit press |{ { #if : | : ] the mit press , pedagogic use of ambiguous expression ambiguity can be use as a pedagogical trick , to force student to reproduce the deduction by themselves . some textbook h. haug , s. koch . quantum theory of the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors , give the same name to the function and to its fourier transform : : . rigorously speak , such an expression require that ;
