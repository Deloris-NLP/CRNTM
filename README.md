#### Implement and experimental details of Context Reinforced Neural Topic Modeling (CRNTM)

We ran our models and all the baselines on a CPU of Intel Core i7-7700, and the run time for each model to run 200 epochs are listed as follows: 
nvdm 2.5h

NVLDA 0.09h

ProLDA 0.09h

GSM 2.6h

TMN 1.67h

NVCTM 1.67h

DVAE 2.33h

CRNTM_GD 3.05h

CRNTM_GSD 22h
